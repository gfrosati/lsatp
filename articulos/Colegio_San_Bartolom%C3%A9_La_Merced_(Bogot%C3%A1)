BILINGUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM
It was created in order to fulfill two main objectives: in one hand, the integration of bilingual subjects and Spanish and on the other hand, the promotion of the internationalization of the school community and the school itself. The former objective has to do with creating mutual agreements, planning activities that promote English in different settings and monitoring the bilingual subjects in terms of methodologies and didactics. The latter objective is related to promote interculturality through immersion and integration programs. Also, this objective encompasses the assessment of the English level of the community through international exams.
Integration of subjects Pacemaker. A virtual newspaper created to make known students matters by short written texts.
Learning Journey. The BEP seeks to integrate bilingual subjects through different and motivating activities during a school day.
